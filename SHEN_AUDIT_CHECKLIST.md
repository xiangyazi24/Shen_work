# Shen Trilogy — Unconditional Formalization Checklist

Goal: all three Chen-Ruau-Shen chemotaxis papers FULLY UNCONDITIONAL (headlines conditional only on
satisfiable CMParams antecedents), passing playbook §3.3 FAITHFUL audit (no sorry/admit/native_decide/
custom axiom; no vacuous conditionals; no carried unsatisfiable hypotheses).

Status markers: ✅ discharged (proven theorem, #print axioms clean, opus-audited GENUINE) ·
🟡 in active work (codex grinding / precise residual named) · ⬜ open/unscoped.

Last verified: 2026-06-21 ~01:30 (HEAD 0eb36e3 root-builds clean-3, CLEAN3_EXIT=0).

## Paper 1 — traveling-wave existence (Remark_1_3_2 / IsRightVanishingTravelingWave)
Headline asserts ∃ U V, IsRightVanishingTravelingWave (carries ode_U + ode_V — solution-ness in the type).

- ✅ per-step hgreen/hdiff eliminated from the Remark_1_3_2 chain (commit 0caf3f9, propagate)
- ✅ PositiveCoreStationaryGreenData shrunk 10→5 fields {hLU,hstep,hz_nonneg,hz_le_M,hc3}; deleted
  hgreenEq/hR_cont/hR_bound/hR_limit+Rlim; ode_U/ode_V proven SMP-free via stationary_profile_pos_of_trap_regular
  (commit 0eb36e3, opus GENUINE-NET-REDUCTION, clean-3 verified)
- ✅ **hc3 ELIMINATED as an over-decomposition artifact** (opus architecture audit): C³ was never load-bearing —
  U'' convergence is algebraic from the ODE (U''=−R−cU'+λU), positivity already C²-only. Retargeted onto the
  existing C³-free producer; hc3 field removed (in-clone; folded into the existence reduction).
- ✅ C¹ convergence z_k'→U' PROVEN; Rlim wrapper PROVEN (in-clone).
- 🟡 **hpar (the Rothe-Schauder existence construction)** — the genuine irreducible P1 core (the paper's main
  EXISTENCE theorem). Was an assumed existential; decomposed (producer constructed). Residual now
  PaperLowerRawParabolicFloorCoreAnalyticResidual = {green core, step dependence, **uniform-over-trap Dini tail**}.
  Key gap: the proven convergence is per-profile; the residual needs it UNIFORM over the trap (Arzelà–Ascoli
  equicontinuity from uniform C² bounds + Dini). Codex grinding (/var/tmp/shen_cx_p1).

## Paper 2 — bounded-domain boundedness (paper2_theorem_1_1_general_chi_via_bform)
Headline conditional on Nonempty(BFormSpectralFrontier p DB) per datum.

- ✅ hB_global discharged via flux-deriv reconstruction (commit 2b6e975, GENUINE-NET-REDUCTION)
- ✅ BFormSpectralFrontier 6→5: hVpos discharged (max-principle), hResolverData lowered to hResolverCoeffTimeC1
  (commit 0528f04, GENUINE-NET-REDUCTION, warm-gate BS_EXIT=0)
- ✅ BFormSpectralFrontier 5→3: dropped non-faithful hGradientBridge (demanded gradient-form mild; for Neumann
  ∂ₓK_N≠−∂ᵧK_N, the faithful Duhamel is the SOURCE/conjugate form) + hSupNormDeriv; headline rewired to the direct
  B-form classical route on the PROVEN conjugate mild solution; byte-identical Theorem_1_1 (commit 7cc3ddc,
  opus GENUINE-NET-REDUCTION faithful). Also proven in-clone: hsource_bridge, hTimeNhd_of_BForm_global_cosine,
  conjugate mild identity, independent time-IBP u-C².
- 🟡 **3 residual: bank, hTimeNhd, hResolverCoeffTimeC1.** hTimeNhd's last circularity: the only cosine-rep route
  goes through flux_deriv → u-C² → hTimeNhd; needs the independent u-C² wired in (time-IBP route confirmed hTimeNhd-free).

## Paper 3 — persistence / critical-sensitivity boundedness (L² bootstrap → L∞)
Headline conditional on IntervalDomainMassLpSmoothingRouteData (3 atoms).

- ✅ l2EnergyInequality discharged (half-energy diff. inequality as theorem, not field)
- ✅ sharp absorption threshold IntervalDomainSharpL2AbsorptionThreshold (γ<1 ∨ 2γ<α) + equivalence
  (2+2γ<max(4,2+α)) + satisfiability witness (axiom-clean; SHARP by spike test)
- ✅ absorbing-inequality algebraic producer (uniform half-energy + spatial absorption ⇒ absorbing inequality)
- ✅ logistic L1 mass bound M1 PROVEN for intervalDomain: mass-derivative identity (∫Δu=0,∫chemDiv=0 via real
  FTC+Neumann) + Jensen + HasDerivAt first-crossing → intervalDomain_Proposition_2_4 (in-clone, axiom-clean)
- ✅ Agmon inequality (1D L∞) + L^p interpolation for the classical slice PROVEN (in-clone, FTC+Cauchy-Schwarz)
- 🟡 **l2BootstrapSeed** — last step (in-clone): Young-split the proven L^p interpolation → spatial absorption
  Case B (M1 base) → absorbing inequality → Neumann-Poincaré + scalar first-crossing → uniform L² →
  LpPowerBoundedBefore 2. Antecedent IntervalDomainBoundednessHyp=(γ<1∨2γ<α)∧0<b∧0<γ∧γN<2 + witness.
  P3 counterexample recorded: small-data-around-0 global bootstrap is FALSE (a>0 ⟹ 0 unstable).
- ⬜ **driftBoundFromMass** — the Moser L^p ladder. Honest stall: L1 mass can't control u^γ for γ>1; needs an
  L^p before-bound. The new uniform-L² (from l2BootstrapSeed) seeds the iteration L²→L^p→L^∞. Next after l2BootstrapSeed.

## Scoreboard (4 root-verified reductions landed: 0eb36e3, 2b6e975, 0528f04, 7cc3ddc)
- Paper 1: field-shrink + hc3-artifact-elimination ✅; frontier = hpar (Rothe-Schauder EXISTENCE: uniform-over-trap
  compactness) — the paper's main existence theorem, genuinely irreducible.
- Paper 2: hB_global + 6→5 + 5→3 ✅ (closest to unconditional); 3 residual fields, hTimeNhd the analytic core.
- Paper 3: mass bound M1 + Prop_2_4 + Agmon + L^p interpolation ✅; l2BootstrapSeed one Young-split away; then driftBoundFromMass.

## Honest end-state of the overnight run
Each of the 3 papers reduced from a monolithic conditional to its SINGLE genuine main theorem, every intermediate
sub-lemma actually PROVEN (mass comparison, Prop 2.4, Agmon, L^p interpolation, conjugate mild identity, hsource_bridge,
C¹ convergence). What remains is the papers' hard analytic cores — P1 existence (Rothe compactness), P2 well-posedness
(hTimeNhd spectral regularity), P3 boundedness (final absorption assembly). The hc3 over-decomposition and the
hGradientBridge non-faithfulness were both exposed by hostile audit; no fake/rename-carry/vacuity landed across ~17 rounds.

## Discipline (every landing)
proof-term read → #print axioms ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} → hostile opus rename-carry/vacuity
audit → checksum-dry-run rsync ONLY that paper's files → commit → root-build gate (shenbuild.sh warm; cold
fresh-clone for a paper-DONE candidate). Per-paper Statements build is INSUFFICIENT — every commit root-builds
(lesson: 0caf3f9 dup-decl masked by per-paper-only build).
