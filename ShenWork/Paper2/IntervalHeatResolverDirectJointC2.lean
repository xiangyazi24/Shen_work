/-- The raw `n`-th resolver cosine term for heat Level0.

For `u = conjugatePicardIter p u₀ 0`, this is
`(t,x) ↦ resolverTimeCoeff p u n t * cos(nπx)`, where
`resolverTimeCoeff p u n t = (intervalNeumannResolverCoeff p (u t) n).re`.
The elliptic identity later rewrites this as
`(μ+λ_n)⁻¹ * cosineCoeffs (ν * (S(t)u₀)^γ) n` in the analytic bounds. -/
def resolverTerm (p : CM2Params) (u₀ : intervalDomainPoint → ℝ) (n : ℕ) :
    ℝ × ℝ → ℝ :=
  fun q => resolverTimeCoeff p (conjugatePicardIter p u₀ 0) n q.1 * cosineMode n q.2

/-- The cutoff resolver term, exactly analogous to `cutoffHeatTerm` in
`IntervalHeatSemigroupHighRegularity.lean`.

The cutoff is zero before `c/2` and equals one on `[c,∞)`, so for a target
`s₀ > c` this term agrees with the raw resolver term near `(s₀,x₀)`. -/
def cutoffResolverTerm (p : CM2Params) (u₀ : intervalDomainPoint → ℝ)
    (c : ℝ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ :=
  fun q => smoothRightCutoff (c / 2) c q.1 * resolverTerm p u₀ n q

/-- Analytic input: each cutoff resolver term is globally joint `C²`.

This is the resolver analogue of `cutoffHeatTerm_contDiff_two`.  The intended proof
is local in the time coordinate:

* if `q.1 < c/2`, the cutoff term is locally zero;
* if `q.1 > 0`, the heat Level0 profile is positive-time smooth, and the source
  coefficient `t ↦ cosineCoeffs (ν * (S(t)u₀)^γ) n` is `C²` by differentiating the
  heat series under the integral twice;
* the resolver weight `(μ+λ_n)⁻¹` is constant in time;
* multiplication by the smooth cutoff preserves `C²`.

This is intentionally left as an analytic `sorry`; the cutoff/tsum/equality
framework below does not depend on its internal proof. -/

/-- Placeholder majorant for the cutoff resolver term.

The real majorant should be built from compact-positive-time bounds for the first
three time derivatives of the resolver coefficient and the spatial weights
`valueCosWeight 0/1/2`.  It is kept as a definition so the `contDiff_tsum` wiring is
fully explicit. -/

/-- Analytic input: the cutoff resolver majorant is summable at every joint order
`k ≤ 2`.

Intended proof: on the compact positive-time support of the cutoff derivatives,
the source coefficients for `ν * (S(t)u₀)^γ` have enough NeumannTower / IBP decay;
the elliptic weight `(μ+λ_n)⁻¹` cancels the worst value-series spatial weight, and
likewise gives the gradient-series summability needed downstream. -/

/-- **Direct cutoff resolver joint `C²` for heat Level0.**

This is the resolver-series analogue of
`HeatSemigroupJointRegularity.heatSemigroup_jointContDiffAt_two`.

The proof is intentionally the same three-step transfer:

1. the cutoff resolver series is globally `ContDiff ℝ 2` by `contDiff_tsum`;
2. the raw resolver series agrees with the cutoff resolver series near `s₀ > c`;
3. the actual lifted coupled concentration agrees with the raw resolver series near
   interior `x₀ ∈ (0,1)`.

The hard analytic estimates are isolated in the three upstream `sorry` lemmas:
`cutoffResolverTerm_contDiff_two`, `cutoffResolverMajorant_summable`, and
`cutoffResolverTerm_iteratedFDeriv_bound`. -/
