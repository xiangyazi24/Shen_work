  Lemma 3.1, the `a = b = 0` branch: reusable max-side Grönwall reduction
  + the chemotaxis obstruction finding.

  ## What the branch asks

  `Lemma_3_1`'s second alternative (Statements.lean) is, with `χ₀ ≤ 0`:
    `a = 0 → b = 0 → ∀ T>0, ∀ classical (u,v), SupNormNonincreasingOn u (Ioo 0 T)`.

  ## FINDING: `a = b = 0` is NOT pure heat unless `χ₀ = 0`

  The (CM) momentum equation of a classical solution is
    `u_t = Δu − χ₀·chemotaxisDiv p u v + u·(a − b·u^α)`.
  Setting `a = b = 0` kills only the LOGISTIC reaction `u(a−bu^α)`; the
  chemotaxis transport term `−χ₀·chemotaxisDiv` SURVIVES whenever
  `χ₀ ≠ 0`.  Expanding it (divergence form):
    `−χ₀·∂ₓ(u·φ(v)·∂ₓv) = −χ₀·φ·∂ₓv·∂ₓu − χ₀·∂ₓ(φ·∂ₓv)·u`,
  i.e. `u_t = Δu + B·∂ₓu + C·u` with `C := −χ₀·∂ₓ(φ(v)∂ₓv)`.  At an
  interior max `x*` of `u` (`∂ₓu(x*)=0`, `Δu(x*)≤0`):
    `u_t(x*) = Δu(x*) + C(x*)·u(x*)`,
  and `C(x*) = −χ₀·(φ·v_xx + φ'·v_x²)` is SIGN-INDEFINITE for `χ₀ < 0`
  (`v_xx = μv − ν u^γ` from the elliptic equation, `φ' < 0`).  So the
  spatial maximum can INCREASE: `SupNormNonincreasingOn` is FALSE for the
  full `χ₀ ≤ 0` branch — it holds only in the genuine pure-heat sub-case
  `χ₀ = 0` (where `B = C = 0`).  The "pure-heat / sub-Markov" comment on
  the branch is correct only for `χ₀ = 0`.

  ## What IS clean and reusable

  Even the true `χ₀ = 0` sub-case needs a maximum principle for an
  ARBITRARY classical solution (the sub-Markov semigroup bound applies to
  `u = S(t)u₀`, which requires uniqueness, not in scope here).  The
  parabolic-max-principle conclusion reduces, via Grönwall with rate `0`,
  to a one-sided Dini condition on the sup-norm trajectory.  This file
  provides that reduction — `supNorm_nonincreasing_of_dini` — the honest
  interface for closing the branch once the Dini input is supplied (at an
  interior/boundary argmax, `u_t ≤ 0` for the pure-heat operator).  It is
  the max-side mirror of `MinPersistenceAtoms.hamilton_lower_bound`.

  ## Conclusion

  The `a = b = 0` sorry is NOT closed here: it is too strong as stated
  (`χ₀ ≤ 0`) and even its true `χ₀ = 0` narrowing needs the deferred
  max-principle Dini input.  The branch should be narrowed to `χ₀ = 0`
  (or proved through the full chemotaxis maximum principle).  This file
  delivers the reusable reduction and records the obstruction.

  No `sorry`/`admit`/custom `axiom`.

/-- **Max-side Grönwall reduction (reusable, TRUE).**  If the sup-norm
trajectory `M(t) := ‖u(t)‖_∞` is continuous on `Ioo 0 T` and satisfies
the one-sided Dini condition "M does not increase to the right" — for
every interior `x` and every `r > 0` the forward difference quotient
`(M z − M x)/(z − x)` is `< r` arbitrarily close to the right of `x` —
then `M` is non-increasing on `Ioo 0 T`.

This is exactly the parabolic-maximum-principle conclusion stripped of
all PDE content: the PDE enters only through the Dini hypothesis (at an
argmax, `u_t ≤ 0` for the pure-heat operator forces it). -/
