  ## Intended task vs. what is actually provable

  The intended task was to write an UNCONDITIONAL producer

      limitRegularityInputsCore_unconditional :
        ∀ (p) (hχ0 : p.χ₀ = 0) (regime) (u₀) (PID u₀)
          (D : GradientMildSolutionData p u₀),
            Thm11ChiZeroFinal.LimitRegularityInputsCore p u₀ D

  collecting the ledger's 25+ fields from existing infrastructure, thereby
  discharging the `Hcore` hypothesis of `paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_final`
  and making Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0) unconditional modulo only `hPLF`.

  **This producer cannot exist, because `LimitRegularityInputsCore` is
  VACUOUS (uninhabited for every `D`).**  This file proves that fact
  rather than faking the producer.

  ## The obstruction (machine-checked below)

  Two of the Core's fields are mutually contradictory:

    * `hC2t : ∀ σ, ContDiff ℝ 2 (intervalDomainLift (D.u σ))`
      — GLOBAL `C²` of the zero-extension `intervalDomainLift` (which is
      `f` on `[0,1]` and `0` off it; see `IntervalDomain.intervalDomainLift`).
      Global `C²` ⟹ global continuity ⟹ the value at the endpoint `0`
      equals the left limit, which is `0` (the lift is identically `0` on
      `(-∞,0)`).  Hence `intervalDomainLift (D.u σ) 0 = 0`.

    * `hpost : ∀ σ, ∀ x ∈ Icc 0 1, 0 < intervalDomainLift (D.u σ) x`
      — strict positivity at the (boundary-inclusive) point `x = 0`, i.e.
      `0 < intervalDomainLift (D.u σ) 0`.

  Together: `0 < intervalDomainLift (D.u 0) 0 = 0`, contradiction.  The
  argument uses NOTHING about `D` beyond the two ledger fields, so the
  structure is uninhabited for ANY `GradientMildSolutionData` — independent
  of the regime hypotheses, the PID, or `χ₀`.

  This is exactly the vacuity flagged in the project memory ("global-C² of
  0-extension ⊥ endpoint positivity") and acknowledged in
  `IntervalDomainLogisticWeakH2Adapter`'s header ("The ledger's vacuity came
  from asking `ContDiff ℝ 2 (intervalDomainLift (D.u σ))` (global) — false
  for the 0-extension positive at the Neumann endpoints").

  ## Consequence for Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0)

  `paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_final` is gated on
  `Hcore : ∀ u₀, PID u₀ → ∀ D, LimitRegularityInputsCore p u₀ D`.  Since the
  conclusion type is uninhabited, `Hcore` is itself unsatisfiable; the final
  theorem is a valid implication with an UNSATISFIABLE premise (a vacuous
  conditional — `#print axioms` cannot detect this).  It is therefore NOT an
  unconditional proof of Theorem 1.1.

  ## The fix (a structural decision for the senior author)

  To inhabit a per-datum core one must RETYPE the offending fields so they
  match what the real solution / restart cosine representation genuinely
  supplies — the additive-adapter route the project already established:

    * replace `hC2t` (global `C²` of the lift) by the cosine-representation
      data the adapters consume on `[0,1]` (eigenvalue-summability + `[0,1]`
      agreement with `∑ₙ bₙ cos(nπ·)`), which is genuinely `C²` and is what
      `IntervalDomainLogisticWeakH2Adapter`/`hpdeData` already use;
    * restrict the `∀ σ : ℝ` quantifiers (`hpost`/`hubt`/`hG1t`/`hG2t`/...)
      to the range `σ ∈ (0, D.T]` where `D.hpos`/`D.hbound` actually hold
      (they are false for `σ ≤ 0` and `σ > D.T`).

  Independently of the typing, several fields still have NO producer in the
  current codebase and are genuine open analytic estimates (uniform sup /
  gradient / Hessian bounds `hubt`/`hG1t`/`hG2t`; strict resolver positivity
  `Hvpos` via the elliptic strong maximum principle; the resolver-source
  `Hvsrc`; per-slice continuity `hLc`; the restart representation `hpdeData`).
  Retyping alone does not inhabit the core; those estimates must be proved.

  No `sorry`, no `admit`, no custom `axiom`, no `native_decide`.

/-- **The per-datum cosine-coefficient TIME-continuity provider.**

For every canonical Picard-limit datum `D`, the cosine coefficients of the iterate
logistic sources are continuous in time on every window `[a', τ] ⊆ (0, D.T]`.  This
is the SINGLE iterate-side ingredient the spatial cone construction does not return
(it is the time-direction continuity, not the spatial `HasContinuousSlices`); it is
discharged from the tower via
`IntervalPicardTowerProjection.hiter_cont_of_tower` (see `IntervalPicardTowerSupply`).
Feeding it discharges the `hsrc0` argument of `picardIterateResidualData_of_core`
through the non-circular spatial Stage-A route. -/

/-! ## FIX LANDED — the vacuity is gone (2026-06-07)

The contradictory `hC2t` field (global `C²` of the zero-extension lift) has been
REMOVED from `LimitRegularityInputsCore` and replaced by the per-slice cosine
representation `(bc, hbsum, hagree)` — exactly the additive-adapter route flagged
above.  The representation is consistent with endpoint positivity (`cs σ` is the
genuinely-`C²` cosine series that agrees with the lift on `[0,1]`), so the Core is
no longer uninhabited, and the former machine-checked vacuity theorem
`limitRegularityInputsCore_uninhabited` no longer typechecks (its `(C.hC2t 0)`
projection is gone) — which is the intended outcome.

The representation is wired into every former `hC2t` consumer by
`ShenWork.IntervalDomainLimitSourceRepresentation.limitSource_duhamelSourceTimeC1_of_representation`,
which feeds the genuinely-`C²` series into the existing explicit quadratic-decay
machinery (uniform constant `2·B_log(M,G1,G2)`) and transports the resulting cosine
coefficients to the lift via `[0,1]`-agreement.  The remaining genuine analytic
estimates listed above (`hubt`/`hG1t`/`hG2t`/`Hvpos`/`Hvsrc`/`hLc`/`hpdeData`) are
unaffected by the retype and remain to be produced. -/

/-- **Per-datum producer of `ReducedLimitRegularityInputs` (χ₀ = 0).**

Scaffold for the unconditional provider: given a positive initial datum and a
`GradientMildSolutionData`, assemble the reduced χ₀ = 0 ledger.  The structural
regime fields are immediate; the remaining fields are filled incrementally —
`bc`/`hbsum`/`hagree` from the Picard limit's restart cosine representation
(`IntervalPicardLimitRestartWeak.limit_lift_eq_cosineSeries_weak`), the source
families from M3b, `hpde_u`/`Hvsrc`/`Hvpos` from the representation adapters, and
the K2 sup/gradient/Hessian bounds from Picard-iterate regularity.

NOTE: a `def` (not `theorem`): the structure carries DATA fields (`bc`, `M₀`,
`Msup`, `adott`, …) that downstream `limitRegularityInputs_of_reduced` projects,
so the result must be reducible. -/

  --
  -- WHY STILL `sorry` (residual is NOT `hcontP`): wiring the inclusive producer here

  -- (`limit_lift_eq_cosineSeries_of_subtypeCont_patched`, `summable_*_limitCoeff_*`) is
  -- itself PROVEN FROM a `DuhamelSourceBddOn (patchedSource …)` package — so the
  -- Provider's `hagreeF`/`hbsumF`/`hG1tF`/`hG2tF` all consume `hsrc0F` (see lines below:

  -- builds `hsrc0F` is an unsatisfiable `have`-ordering (`hsrc0F ← hagreeF ← hsrc0F`).

  -- (the per-compact K2 / PDE-smoothing estimate), NOT the right-continuity `hcontP`

/-! ## Wdata-only narrowing: cone facts supplied at the construction site

The provider's residual surface is shrunk from the THREE-leg
`HresWiring.PicardIterateResidualCore` (`hFacts`, `hcont_iter`, `Wdata`) to the
single genuinely-open per-window K2 leg `Wdata`.  The other two legs
(`hFacts`/`hcont_iter`) are NOT open residuals — they are RETURNED by the cone
construction `coneGradientMildSolutionData_exists_with_data` at the construction
site (where `D.T = δ`, so the cone's `∀ n, HasContinuousSlices δ (picardIter …)`
and `∃ F : PicardConvFacts, F.T = δ` transport verbatim to `D.T`).  They cannot be
recovered from a bare canonical-Picard-limit datum of *arbitrary* horizon, so they
must be wired in WHERE the datum is freshly cone-constructed — which is what the
two helpers below do (replacing the fact-stripping plain-cone bridge
`ConeQuantBridge.quantitativeLocalExistence_chiZero` with a fact-carrying one). -/

/-- **FINAL WIRING — Paper 2 Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0), Wdata-only residual surface.**

⚠️ **FIDELITY / SCOPE BANNER (read before citing this as "Theorem 1.1").**
The name says `unconditional` but this theorem is NOT the paper's Theorem 1.1.
It is a FRAGMENT, restricted on FIVE axes, and is CONDITIONAL:
  1. `p.χ₀ = 0` — the paper's Theorem 1.1 assumes `χ₀ ≤ 0`.  At `χ₀ = 0` the
     chemotaxis term `−χ₀∇·(uᵐχ(v)∇v)` vanishes identically and the u-equation
     DECOUPLES into the scalar reaction–diffusion equation `uₜ = Δu + u(a−buᵅ)`
     — i.e. this is the degenerate slice where the model is no longer a
     chemotaxis system.  The genuine case `χ₀ < 0` is untouched.
  2. `intervalDomain` is N = 1 (`Subtype (Icc 0 1)`); the paper is `Ω ⊂ ℝᴺ`,
     and its analytic core is the N-dimensional elliptic regularity it dodges.
  3. `0 < a` AND `0 < b` hardwired; the paper's part (2) `a = b = 0` is only
     discharged vacuously under the contradictory `0 < a ∧ a = 0`.
  4. `1 ≤ α`, `1 ≤ γ` are blanket hypotheses; the paper assumes only `α, γ > 0`.
  5. CONDITIONAL on the providers `Hiter` + `HWdata`, which bottom out at the
     residual `TowerConeAnalyticResidual = { hsrc0 }`.  `hsrc0` is the paper's
     genuine analytic content (time-C¹ / ℓ¹ Duhamel-source regularity) carried
     as a HYPOTHESIS, and its as-typed satisfiability (an ℓ¹ envelope at `s = 0`
     for merely-continuous `u₀`) is OPEN — see HANDOFF/k1-wall-plan.md.  Until
     `hsrc0` is discharged or shown satisfiable, this is a conditional theorem.
Per the formalization-playbook verdict labels: statement layer FAITHFUL (the
PDE, both equations, Neumann BC, genuine C² regularity, the exact (1.21) bound
are all real, not hollow), parameter coverage FRAGMENT, residual CONDITIONAL.

Assembles Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0) directly from the regime constants and the
SINGLE-leg residual provider `HWdata`, via `paper2_theorem_1_1_from_quant_and_hlocal`:

    quantitativeLocalExistence_chiZero_wdata HWdata   -- hQuant (fact-carrying cone)
      ⊕ hMildLocal_chi0_zero_of_wdata HWdata          -- hlocal (fact-carrying cone)
      → paper2_theorem_1_1_from_quant_and_hlocal
      → Theorem_1_1 intervalDomain p

**The residual surface is now `Wdata`-only.**  Compared with the former
three-leg `HresWiring.PicardIterateResidualCore` provider (`hFacts`, `hcont_iter`,
`Wdata`), the cone facts `hFacts`/`hcont_iter` are NO LONGER hypotheses: both the
quantitative- and local-side bridges build their cone datum with
`coneGradientMildSolutionData_exists_with_data`, which RETURNS the iterate
slice-continuity bundle `hcont_iter` and the ball/geometric `PicardConvFacts`
package at the construction horizon `D.T = δ`.  These two legs are therefore
discharged at the point of construction — they are not open residuals — leaving
the genuinely-open per-window K2 leg `Wdata` as the only provider obligation.
(`hsliceTC` and `hLcont_lim` remain discharged universally inside
`picardIterateResidualData_of_core`.)

The narrowing replaces the fact-stripping plain-cone bridge
`ConeQuantBridge.quantitativeLocalExistence_chiZero` with the fact-carrying
`quantitativeLocalExistence_chiZero_wdata`; the universal frontier residual `hPLF`
(`PicardLimitRestartFrontier p`, a `∀ D` Prop applied to the plain-cone datum after
its facts were stripped) is no longer used.

The hypotheses are `p.χ₀ = 0`, the structural regime constants
(`0 < a`, `0 < b`, `1 ≤ α`, `1 ≤ γ`), and the two providers `Hiter` + `HWdata`
(see the FIDELITY BANNER above).  As of commit 32c8fee the `hinterior` analytic
core is no longer a raw `sorry`: it is discharged by
`IntervalRestartSliceLipschitz.hinterior_of_src0`, CONDITIONAL on the `hsrc0`
package threaded through the providers.  `#print axioms` therefore reports
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (no `sorryAx`) — but this is a
CONDITIONAL theorem (the analytic content lives in the `Hiter`/`HWdata` →
`hsrc0` hypothesis), NOT an unconditional proof; and the clean-tree
certification of that `#print axioms` is tracked separately (the earlier
"clean" reports were run on a divergent remote olean tree). -/

/-! ## §W6b — Per-constructed-datum provider surface (additive, narrowed).

`paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_unconditional` consumes the two `∀ D` providers
`IterCoeffTimeContProvider`/`HWdata` and invokes them ONLY at the cone-constructed
datum (see `quantitativeLocalExistence_chiZero_wdata` / `hMildLocal_chi0_zero_of_wdata`:
the datum is obtained from `coneGradientMildSolutionData_exists_with_data` and the
providers are called at exactly that `D`).  The `∀ D` form is therefore stronger than
the consumption pattern requires.  This section adds — ADDITIVELY, with ZERO change to
the existing declarations — a capstone whose provider OWNS the datum: a per-`u₀`
existence of a small-horizon datum bundling the two iterate-side legs at THAT datum.
This is the invocation-restricted surface; it is what the cone construction can
actually instantiate (the gate/positivity facts hold only at the cone horizon). -/

/-- The two iterate-side legs (`WdataProvider` + per-window cosine-coefficient TIME
continuity) bundled at a SINGLE datum `D` — the exact pair the reduced-ledger
assembler `restartAndFrontierCore_of_wdata` consumes. -/

/-- **The narrowed, per-constructed-datum supply.**

For every mass `M_in > 0` there is a horizon `δ > 0` such that every admissible datum
`u₀` (continuous, `|u₀| ≤ M_in`, nonnegative, positive somewhere) admits a packaged
`GradientMildSolutionData` on `[0, δ]` carrying the cone-returned slice-continuity and
`PicardConvFacts` AND the two iterate-side legs `DatumIterLegs` at that datum.  This is
the EXACT return shape of `coneGradientMildSolutionData_exists_with_data` augmented with
`DatumIterLegs` (and minus the unused strict-positivity conjunct).  Crucially the datum
`D` is supplied here, so the iterate-side residual is owed only at the cone horizon. -/

/-- **FINAL WIRING — Paper 2 Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0) from the narrowed datum supply.**

ADDITIVE companion to `paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_unconditional`.  Same conclusion
(`Theorem_1_1 intervalDomain p`), same regime hypotheses, but the iterate-side residual
is a SINGLE narrowed supply `Hsupply : DatumProviderSupply p` that owns the
cone-constructed datum and bundles the two iterate-side legs at exactly that datum —
the invocation-restricted surface the capstone actually consumes.  No existing
declaration changes. -/
