  ## Intended task vs. what is actually provable

  The intended task was to write an UNCONDITIONAL producer

      limitRegularityInputsCore_unconditional :
        ∀ (p) (hχ0 : p.χ₀ = 0) (regime) (u₀) (PID u₀)
          (D : GradientMildSolutionData p u₀),
            Thm11ChiZeroFinal.LimitRegularityInputsCore p u₀ D

  collecting the ledger's 25+ fields from existing infrastructure, thereby
  discharging the `Hcore` hypothesis of `paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_final`
  and making Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0) unconditional modulo only `hPLF`.

  **This producer cannot exist, because `LimitRegularityInputsCore` is
  VACUOUS (uninhabited for every `D`).**  This file proves that fact
  rather than faking the producer.

  ## The obstruction (machine-checked below)

  Two of the Core's fields are mutually contradictory:

    * `hC2t : ∀ σ, ContDiff ℝ 2 (intervalDomainLift (D.u σ))`
      — GLOBAL `C²` of the zero-extension `intervalDomainLift` (which is
      `f` on `[0,1]` and `0` off it; see `IntervalDomain.intervalDomainLift`).
      Global `C²` ⟹ global continuity ⟹ the value at the endpoint `0`
      equals the left limit, which is `0` (the lift is identically `0` on
      `(-∞,0)`).  Hence `intervalDomainLift (D.u σ) 0 = 0`.

    * `hpost : ∀ σ, ∀ x ∈ Icc 0 1, 0 < intervalDomainLift (D.u σ) x`
      — strict positivity at the (boundary-inclusive) point `x = 0`, i.e.
      `0 < intervalDomainLift (D.u σ) 0`.

  Together: `0 < intervalDomainLift (D.u 0) 0 = 0`, contradiction.  The
  argument uses NOTHING about `D` beyond the two ledger fields, so the
  structure is uninhabited for ANY `GradientMildSolutionData` — independent
  of the regime hypotheses, the PID, or `χ₀`.

  This is exactly the vacuity flagged in the project memory ("global-C² of
  0-extension ⊥ endpoint positivity") and acknowledged in
  `IntervalDomainLogisticWeakH2Adapter`'s header ("The ledger's vacuity came
  from asking `ContDiff ℝ 2 (intervalDomainLift (D.u σ))` (global) — false
  for the 0-extension positive at the Neumann endpoints").

  ## Consequence for Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0)

  `paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_final` is gated on
  `Hcore : ∀ u₀, PID u₀ → ∀ D, LimitRegularityInputsCore p u₀ D`.  Since the
  conclusion type is uninhabited, `Hcore` is itself unsatisfiable; the final
  theorem is a valid implication with an UNSATISFIABLE premise (a vacuous
  conditional — `#print axioms` cannot detect this).  It is therefore NOT an
  unconditional proof of Theorem 1.1.

  ## The fix (a structural decision for the senior author)

  To inhabit a per-datum core one must RETYPE the offending fields so they
  match what the real solution / restart cosine representation genuinely
  supplies — the additive-adapter route the project already established:

    * replace `hC2t` (global `C²` of the lift) by the cosine-representation
      data the adapters consume on `[0,1]` (eigenvalue-summability + `[0,1]`
      agreement with `∑ₙ bₙ cos(nπ·)`), which is genuinely `C²` and is what
      `IntervalDomainLogisticWeakH2Adapter`/`hpdeData` already use;
    * restrict the `∀ σ : ℝ` quantifiers (`hpost`/`hubt`/`hG1t`/`hG2t`/...)
      to the range `σ ∈ (0, D.T]` where `D.hpos`/`D.hbound` actually hold
      (they are false for `σ ≤ 0` and `σ > D.T`).

  Independently of the typing, several fields still have NO producer in the
  current codebase and are genuine open analytic estimates (uniform sup /
  gradient / Hessian bounds `hubt`/`hG1t`/`hG2t`; strict resolver positivity
  `Hvpos` via the elliptic strong maximum principle; the resolver-source
  `Hvsrc`; per-slice continuity `hLc`; the restart representation `hpdeData`).
  Retyping alone does not inhabit the core; those estimates must be proved.

  No `sorry`, no `admit`, no custom `axiom`, no `native_decide`.

/-! ## FIX LANDED — the vacuity is gone (2026-06-07)

The contradictory `hC2t` field (global `C²` of the zero-extension lift) has been
REMOVED from `LimitRegularityInputsCore` and replaced by the per-slice cosine
representation `(bc, hbsum, hagree)` — exactly the additive-adapter route flagged
above.  The representation is consistent with endpoint positivity (`cs σ` is the
genuinely-`C²` cosine series that agrees with the lift on `[0,1]`), so the Core is
no longer uninhabited, and the former machine-checked vacuity theorem
`limitRegularityInputsCore_uninhabited` no longer typechecks (its `(C.hC2t 0)`
projection is gone) — which is the intended outcome.

The representation is wired into every former `hC2t` consumer by
`ShenWork.IntervalDomainLimitSourceRepresentation.limitSource_duhamelSourceTimeC1_of_representation`,
which feeds the genuinely-`C²` series into the existing explicit quadratic-decay
machinery (uniform constant `2·B_log(M,G1,G2)`) and transports the resulting cosine
coefficients to the lift via `[0,1]`-agreement.  The remaining genuine analytic
estimates listed above (`hubt`/`hG1t`/`hG2t`/`Hvpos`/`Hvsrc`/`hLc`/`hpdeData`) are
unaffected by the retype and remain to be produced. -/

/-- **Per-datum producer of `ReducedLimitRegularityInputs` (χ₀ = 0).**

Scaffold for the unconditional provider: given a positive initial datum and a
`GradientMildSolutionData`, assemble the reduced χ₀ = 0 ledger.  The structural
regime fields are immediate; the remaining fields are filled incrementally —
`bc`/`hbsum`/`hagree` from the Picard limit's restart cosine representation
(`IntervalPicardLimitRestartWeak.limit_lift_eq_cosineSeries_weak`), the source
families from M3b, `hpde_u`/`Hvsrc`/`Hvpos` from the representation adapters, and
the K2 sup/gradient/Hessian bounds from Picard-iterate regularity.

NOTE: a `def` (not `theorem`): the structure carries DATA fields (`bc`, `M₀`,
`Msup`, `adott`, …) that downstream `limitRegularityInputs_of_reduced` projects,
so the result must be reducible. -/

/-- **FINAL WIRING — Paper 2 Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0), hypothesis-unconditional.**

Chains the per-datum reduced-ledger producer into the threshold-route capstone:

    reducedLimitRegularityInputs_of_picard          -- per-datum reduced ledger
      → limitRegularityInputs_of_reduced            -- reduced ⟹ full ledger
      → restartData_of_inputs / frontierCore_of_inputs  -- ledger ⟹ hPLF
      → paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_of_reduced_inputs    -- capstone
      → Theorem_1_1 intervalDomain p

The statement carries NO frontier hypothesis: `hPLF`
(`PicardLimitRestartFrontier p`) is *not* an independent residual — it is
derived here from the same reduced ledger via `restartData_of_inputs` +
`frontierCore_of_inputs`, exactly as in
`ThresholdQuantBridge.paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_threshold_of_ledger`.  So the
only hypotheses are `p.χ₀ = 0` and the structural regime constants
(`0 < a`, `0 < b`, `1 ≤ α`, `1 ≤ γ`).

HONESTY NOTE — this is wiring, not a completed proof.  The chain bottoms out in
`reducedLimitRegularityInputs_of_picard`, whose data/proof fields are still
`sorry` (the genuine open analytic estimates: `hubt`/`hG1t`/`hG2t` uniform
sup/gradient/Hessian bounds, `Hvpos`/`Hvsrc`/`hpde_u` resolver and PDE residuals,
`hLc` slice continuity, the cosine representation `bc`/`hbsum`/`hagree`, …).  This
theorem's PROOF therefore depends transitively on `sorryAx`
(`#print axioms paper2_theorem_1_1_chiZero_unconditional` will report it); it is
NOT yet an axiom-clean proof of Theorem 1.1.  Its value is structural: it pins
down that *once* `reducedLimitRegularityInputs_of_picard` is discharged
sorry-free, Theorem 1.1 (χ₀ = 0) follows with no further hypotheses — every
remaining obligation is now localized to that single producer. -/
