  **G2 CAPSTONE — the concrete `FrozenStationaryMapSchauderData` fields for the
  Rothe map `Tmap u = rotheLimit (rotheSeq u)`.**

  This file assembles the four `FrozenStationaryMapSchauderData` fields
  (invariance, the diagonal cross-fixed-point, local-uniform compact range,
  local-uniform continuity-in-`u`) for the concrete traveling-wave self-map

      `Tmap u := rotheLimit (rotheSeq u)`,

  where `rotheSeq : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℕ → ℝ → ℝ` is the per-`u`-frozen implicit-Euler
  (Rothe) orbit.  Every per-`u` Rothe property that is established elsewhere
  (the committed `WaveRothe*` bricks) is carried here as an EXPLICIT, satisfiable
  hypothesis on `rotheSeq`, so this file is a pure assembly with no new analytic
  debt beyond the genuinely-deep continuity-in-`u` piece (field 4), which is
  isolated behind a single named sub-lemma hypothesis.

  STATUS OF THE FOUR FIELDS (see the per-theorem docstrings):
    1. `Tmap_maps_trap`        — FULLY ASSEMBLED from `rotheLimit_mem_trap`
                                 (+ `rotheLimit_continuous` for the continuity
                                 slot), under the carried per-`u` trap data.
    2. crossDiagonal           — FULLY WIRED to the committed
                                 `rotheLimit_crossImplicitMap_fixed`.
    3. `Tmap_compactRange`     — ASSEMBLED down to a single named pointwise
                                 selection input `HellyPointwiseSelection`
                                 (the Cantor-diagonal monotone subsequence
                                 selection), which is upgraded to loc-unif via
                                 the committed finite-grid
                                 `locallyUniform_of_pointwise_of_equiLipschitz`.
    4. `Tmap_continuousOn`     — PRECISE STALL.  Reduced to the named
                                 continuous-dependence sub-lemma
                                 `RotheContinuousDependence` (which itself rests
                                 on the UNCOMMITTED `frozenElliptic`-in-`u`
                                 dependence `FrozenEllipticDerivDependence`).
                                 The reduction is built; the sub-lemma is carried.

                                 plus the committed profile lemmas.

For the concrete map `Tmap u := rotheLimit (rotheSeq u)` we package every per-`u`
property of the frozen Rothe orbit `rotheSeq u : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ` that is established by
the committed `WaveRothe*` bricks.  Carrying these as a structure keeps the field
proofs honest: each field uses exactly the committed lemma whose hypotheses these
record, with NO additional assumption smuggled in. -/

by the committed `rotheLimit_mem_trap`: continuity is supplied by
`rotheLimit_continuous` (the loc-unif foundation), and the remaining
order/bound/barrier data come straight from the carried per-`u` Rothe data. -/

/-! ## Field 3 — local-uniform sequentially-compact range

The images `Tmap u_n = rotheLimit (rotheSeq u_n)` are (i) antitone in `x`, (ii)
trapped in `[0,M]` under the exponential barrier, and (iii) share the uniform
Lipschitz bound `M` (from `crossImplicitStep_lipschitz`, uniform in `u`).  A
Helly/Arzelà–Ascoli selection therefore extracts a loc-unif convergent
subsequence with trapped limit.

We split this into TWO honest layers:

  * the **named pointwise selection input** `HellyPointwiseSelection`: from any
    uniformly-bounded, equi-Lipschitz family of functions on `ℝ`, a Cantor
    diagonal over a countable dense set selects a subsequence converging
    *pointwise* to some `g`, with `g` inheriting the same Lipschitz bound.  This
    is the standard Helly selection; it is the only genuinely-combinatorial
    kernel here and is carried as a satisfiable hypothesis;

  * the **loc-unif upgrade**, which is FULLY BUILT here by feeding the pointwise
    limit into the committed finite-grid
    `locallyUniform_of_pointwise_of_equiLipschitz` (`WaveRotheC1`), and the trap
    membership of the limit, which is FULLY BUILT from the carried order/bound
    data via the committed `LocallyUniformConverges.*_of_inMonotoneWaveTrapSet`
    lemmas. -/

/-- **Named pointwise Helly selection input.**
From a sequence `gs : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ` of functions sharing the uniform Lipschitz
bound `Λ` and a uniform pointwise sup-bound `B`, a subsequence converges
*pointwise* to a limit `g` which inherits the Lipschitz bound `Λ`.  This is the
classical Helly selection theorem (Cantor diagonal over `ℚ` + equicontinuity);
it is the only combinatorial kernel of the compactness field and is carried as a
satisfiable hypothesis. -/
def HellyPointwiseSelection (Λ : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ gs : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ,
    (∀ k, ∀ x y, |gs k x - gs k y| ≤ Λ * |x - y|) →
    (∀ k x, |gs k x| ≤ Λ) →
      ∃ subseq : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono subseq ∧
        ∃ g : ℝ → ℝ,
          (∀ x, Tendsto (fun n => gs (subseq n) x) atTop (𝓝 (g x))) ∧
          (∀ x y, |g x - g y| ≤ Λ * |x - y|)

/-- **Loc-unif upgrade of the pointwise Helly limit (FULLY BUILT).**
Given a subsequence `gs ∘ subseq` converging pointwise to `g`, with the shared
uniform Lipschitz bound `Λ` on the iterates and on `g`, the committed
finite-grid lemma `locallyUniform_of_pointwise_of_equiLipschitz` upgrades the
convergence to local-uniform. -/
theorem locallyUniform_of_helly_pointwise
    {gs : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ} {g : ℝ → ℝ} {subseq : ℕ → ℕ} {Λ : ℝ} (hΛ : 0 ≤ Λ)
    (hpt : ∀ x, Tendsto (fun n => gs (subseq n) x) atTop (𝓝 (g x)))

    LocallyUniformConverges (fun n => gs (subseq n)) g :=
  locallyUniform_of_pointwise_of_equiLipschitz hΛ hpt
    (fun n => hgsL (subseq n)) hgL

/-- **Field 3 (compactRange).**
For the trap `InMonotoneWaveTrapSet κ M`, the range of the Rothe map is
local-uniformly sequentially compact.  The pointwise selection is supplied by the
carried `HellyPointwiseSelection M` input; the loc-unif upgrade and the trap
membership of the limit are built here from the committed pieces.

The selection is applied to the image sequence `gs n := Tmap (seq n)`, which:
  * is uniformly `M`-Lipschitz (each image's `limitLip`),
  * is uniformly sup-bounded by `M` (each image's `limit_le_M` + `limit_nonneg`),
so the carried Helly selection produces a pointwise-convergent subsequence whose
loc-unif limit `g` is antitone (limit of antitone images), nonneg, and
`≤ upperBarrier`, hence trapped. -/

/-! ## Field 4 — continuity-in-`u` (the genuine analytic piece)

`u_n → u` loc-unif  ⟹  `Tmap u_n → Tmap u` loc-unif.

This is THE remaining analytic depth.  The dependence of `Tmap u = rotheLimit
(rotheSeq u)` on `u` runs entirely through the frozen drift
`V_u' = deriv (frozenElliptic p u)`, which enters the per-step Green map
`crossImplicitMap p c lam u (·) (·)` (the flux term
`∫ K'(x-y)·(W y)^m · V_u'(y) dy`).  Establishing continuity-in-`u` therefore
requires TWO inputs, neither committed:

  (A) **`FrozenEllipticDerivDependence`** — UNCOMMITTED.
      `u_n → u` loc-unif  ⟹  `V_{u_n}' → V_u'` loc-unif (and uniformly bounded).
      This is the genuinely deep elliptic continuous-dependence statement
      (`Psi`/`frozenElliptic` is built from a convolution of `(u y)^γ`; its first
      derivative depends continuously on `u` in the loc-unif topology by
      dominated convergence on the kernel-derivative convolution).  A grep over
      Paper1 confirms only continuity/tendsto of `frozenElliptic` in the SPATIAL
      variable `x` for FIXED `u` is committed; the dependence in `u` is NOT.

  (B) **per-step + limit propagation** — given (A), each Green step
      `crossImplicitMap p c lam u_n (·) (·)` converges to
      `crossImplicitMap p c lam u (·) (·)` by dominated convergence (same
      argument as the committed `rothe_fluxIntegral_tendsto`), and the uniform
      contraction constants pass this through the Rothe limit.

We MAP this precisely and isolate it behind a single named hypothesis
`RotheContinuousDependence`, which packages exactly the conclusion of field 4 for
the concrete map, derivable from (A)+(B).  The loc-unif compatibility (that the
output IS `LocalUniformContinuousOn`) is then a trivial unfolding, built below.

THE STALL IS HONEST AND PRECISE: the named sub-lemma
`FrozenEllipticDerivDependence` is the single missing analytic brick, and field 4
is exactly its (plus per-step propagation) consequence. -/

/-- **(A) Named UNCOMMITTED sub-lemma — continuous dependence of `V_u'` on `u`.**
If `u_n → u` locally uniformly with all `u_n, u` trapped, then the frozen drifts
`V_{u_n}' = deriv (frozenElliptic p u_n)` converge to `V_u'` locally uniformly.
This is the deep elliptic continuous-dependence statement; it is NOT committed in
Paper1 (only the spatial continuity/tendsto of `frozenElliptic` for fixed `u`
is).  Carried as a satisfiable hypothesis. -/

The full conclusion of field 4 for the concrete map: `u_n → u` loc-unif forces
`Tmap u_n → Tmap u` loc-unif.  Derivable from `FrozenEllipticDerivDependence`

contraction constants; carried here as the named output to keep the deep piece
isolated. -/

/-! ## Field 5 — assembling the full `FrozenStationaryMapSchauderData`

With all four fields available (1, 2 fully built; 3 modulo the named Helly
selection; 4 modulo the named continuous-dependence), we package the concrete
`FrozenStationaryMapSchauderData` for `Tmap u := rotheLimit (rotheSeq u)` and feed
it into the committed bridge `b1_chiNeg_existence_of_schauderData`, reducing the
B1 χ≤0 headline to ONLY the G1 abstract Schauder principle plus the committed
per-fixed-point profile lemmas. -/

/-- **Assembled concrete Schauder data for the Rothe map.**
Packages fields 1–4 into `FrozenStationaryMapSchauderData p c lam trap Tmap` with
`trap := InMonotoneWaveTrapSet κ M` and `Tmap u := rotheLimit (rotheSeq u)`.
Inputs: the per-`u` Rothe data, the upper-barrier boundedness, the named Helly
selection, and the named continuous-dependence. -/

/-- **Lower-pinned concrete Schauder data for the Rothe map.**

This is the honest pinned refinement of `rotheSchauderData`: the ordinary bare
Rothe data supply the underlying monotone-trap map, continuity, compactness and
cross-diagonal fields; the additional lower-barrier invariant is the concrete
claim that every Rothe iterate remains above `φ`, which then passes to the Rothe
limit. -/

/-- **B1 χ≤0 existence from the concrete Rothe Schauder data.**
Feeds the assembled `rotheSchauderData` into the committed bridge
`b1_chiNeg_existence_of_schauderData`, producing a trapped self-frozen
traveling-wave profile.  The B1 χ≤0 headline now reduces to:
  * the G1 abstract principle `LocalUniformSchauderFixedPointPrinciple trap`,
  * the per-fixed-point committed profile lemmas (`hGreen`, `hpos`, `hbdd`,
    `hlim_neg`, `hlim_pos`),
  * the named selection/dependence inputs (`hHelly`, `hdep`) and per-`u` Rothe
    data (`hdata`) — all satisfiable from the committed `WaveRothe*` bricks
    except `hdep`'s deep `FrozenEllipticDerivDependence` core. -/
